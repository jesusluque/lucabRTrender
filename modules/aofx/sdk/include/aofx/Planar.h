// A solved plane, and how it gets into a document.
//
// WHY IT LIVES IN THE DOCUMENT
//
// The same argument `Tracks.h` makes, and it is worth making once more
// because the numbers here are smaller and the saving is larger. Solving a
// plane needs two networks, a GPU and a render host; *using* the answer
// needs a matrix multiply. Keeping the two apart is what lets a comp open on
// a laptop that could not have solved anything, and lets somebody rewire
// everything downstream of the tracker without waking the render host.
//
// Nine floats a frame and a byte that says whether the frame was solved at
// all. Two thousand nine hundred frames of that is a hundred kilobytes,
// a hundred and forty in base64 -- the same order as an analysis this format
// already carries, so the document is not the thing to economise on.
//
// WHAT IS NOT HERE
//
// The features and the matches. They are megabytes a frame, they are worth a
// millisecond to make again, and a document is not a disk cache. What is
// stored is the *answer*: where the plane went.
//
// LITTLE-ENDIAN, AND SAID -- for the reason `Tracks.h` says it.
