// What a matching pipeline puts in a plane, and where.
//
// A tracker split into nodes -- a detector, a matcher, a fitter -- has to
// hand keypoints and correspondences from one node to the next, and the SDK
// offers exactly two ways to do that (`Effect.h`): an attachment, which is
// small by contract, and a plane, which is a frame-sized float4 buffer. A
// thousand descriptors of sixty-four floats is not small, so it goes in a
// plane, and then somebody has to say *where in the plane* -- which is this
// file.
//
// WHY A HEADER PIXEL AND A VERSION
//
// The producer and the consumer are different plugins, built at different
// times, and on a render host they may be different builds again. A layout
// agreed by comment is a layout that drifts, and a reader that trusts a
// buffer's shape reads garbage as data: a thousand keypoints at the wrong
// stride is not an error, it is a track that wanders. So every block starts
// with its magic and its version, and a reader that does not know the
// version **reads nothing** rather than the wrong offsets. `Tracks.h` learnt
// this for the document; a plane needs it for the same reason.
//
// WHY POSITIONS AND NOT INDICES IN `matches`
//
// A sparse matcher (XFeat and LightGlue) pairs indices into two keypoint
// sets. A dense one (LoFTR) has no indices to give -- it answers with
// positions. Carrying indices would need a second block shape for the dense
// path and a second fitter to read it, so `matches` carries the two
// positions and one fitter serves both. The cost is four floats a match
// instead of two; the saving is a node.
//
// WHY OFFSETS IN PIXELS, AND WHICH PIXELS
//
// A plane is addressed as float4 texels on the device (`aofx::Buffer`), so
// everything here counts in texels and a descriptor is a whole number of
// them. Sixty-four floats is sixteen; the offset of keypoint N is
// arithmetic, in a kernel, with no search and no indirection.
//
// **Linear from the start of the buffer, not (x, y).** A buffer's `stride`
// can exceed its width, so texel `i` here is *not* the pixel at
// `(i % width, i / width)` -- it is simply the i'th float4 of the
// allocation. Nothing addresses these blocks as a picture, so the padding
// never matters, and both sides counting the same way is all that is
// required. GeometricTrack's mesh plane already works exactly like this, and
// a reader that assumed a row length instead would find its data shifted by
// the padding on the one machine whose allocator pads.
//
// THESE NUMBERS LIVE TWICE
//
// Here, and in the `.slang` that reads them. Nothing checks that the two
// agree -- the same hazard as a kernel's uniform block -- so a change here
// is a change in both, and the Slang side says so at the top of its file.
