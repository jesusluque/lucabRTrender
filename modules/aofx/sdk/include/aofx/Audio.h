// Sound, as it crosses the boundary.
//
// AUDIO RIDES ON THE PICTURE
//
// This host has no audio timeline. The samples under a frame are a property
// of that frame, the way a matte or a tracked corner is: they hang off the
// picture and go wherever it goes -- through the cache, a crop, a sub-pass at
// another time, the prefetcher, the remote wire. A picture that is delayed
// carries its sound with it and a picture that is dropped drops it, which is
// the whole of the synchronisation argument, and the reason an effect never
// sees a stream: it sees the sound of the frame it is rendering, and hands
// back the sound of the frame it made.
//
// An effect that says nothing about sound gets the host's rule: the sound of
// its inputs, summed (`EffectDesc::audio`). One that changes it -- a gain, a
// mix, a node that reads a file -- fills `RenderRequest::audio`.
