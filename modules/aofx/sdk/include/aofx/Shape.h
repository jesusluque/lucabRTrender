// Shapes: the contract between a host that draws them and an effect that
// renders them.
//
// WHY THE VALUE IS A FLAT ARRAY OF DOUBLES
//
// Because `ParamValue` already carries one, and a new C++ type across this
// boundary would be a new ABI to keep in step -- a vector of structs of vectors
// is exactly the shape of thing that links, loads, and then disagrees about
// where a member lives when two compilers built the two sides.
//
// So a shape parameter travels in `ParamValue::numbers`, and what this header
// adds is the *layout* of that array, written once and read by both sides
// through the same functions. The encoding is self-describing: a reader knows
// how many shapes there are and how long each one is without being told
// anything it did not already receive.
//
// It is the same trade `gpe::Args` makes with its kernels, for the same reason
// and with the same discipline: one definition, a version in the first slot,
// and no caller anywhere writing offsets by hand.
//
// WHAT A SHAPE IS NOT
//
// It is not animated in here. A value handed to `render` is the shape *at that
// time* -- already evaluated, already transformed -- because an effect has no
// business interpolating and no way to know what a keyframe means to this host.
// Where the keys live and how they interpolate is the host's problem, and it
// keeps them in the document rather than in this array.
