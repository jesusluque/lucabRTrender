// AOFX — an alternative to OpenFX, for effects that run on the GPU.
//
// WHAT IT IS FOR
//
// OpenFX is a C ABI designed around host-allocated CPU pixel buffers, with GPU
// rendering bolted on afterwards as an OpenGL extension. It works, and this
// application hosts it. But an effect that wants to run a compute kernel on
// CUDA or Metal has to go through a graphics API to get there, and write the
// same filter twice to reach both.
//
// AOFX is the other way round. An effect declares its kernels in Slang, they
// are compiled at build time to PTX and to a metallib, and the host runs them
// on whichever device the machine has. One filter, both backends, no graphics
// API in the middle.
//
// THE VERSION HANDSHAKE, AND WHY IT IS TWO NUMBERS AND A STRING
//
// The interface is C++ -- virtual functions, std::string, std::vector across
// the boundary. That is a deliberate choice and it has a price: a plugin built
// with a different compiler or standard library than the host will link, load,
// and then corrupt memory in ways that look like anything but the real cause.
//
// So a bundle states what it was built against and the host refuses anything it
// does not recognise. Refusing is the feature. A plugin that will not load and
// says why is a plugin somebody can fix; one that loads and misbehaves is a bug
// report about the wrong thing entirely.

/// Bumped whenever anything in these headers changes shape.
///
/// Not a semantic version: there is no "compatible minor" here, because a
/// vtable layout is compatible or it is not. One number, and a mismatch is a
/// refusal.
/// 2: `Gpu::publish` -- a new virtual on the host interface. A bundle built
/// against 1 would call through a vtable one slot short of the host's.
/// 3: `Gpu::recorder`/`record`/`closeRecorder` -- writing a movie file, the
/// mirror of the clip verbs. Three more slots, same argument. The request also
/// gains the project's rate and whether this render is a delivery, which a
/// node that writes files cannot do without.
/// 4: `ParamDesc::text` -- a String parameter can say it holds a path, and
/// get the chooser button the built-in nodes have always had. A struct the
/// plugin fills and the host reads, so its shape is as much of an agreement
/// as a vtable is.
/// 5: `ParamType::Shape` -- a parameter that is a list of closed shapes, and
/// `aofx/Shape.h` beside it saying how one is laid out inside the numbers a
/// `ParamValue` already carries. No new type crosses the boundary; what is new
/// is an agreement about the contents of an array, which is as much of a
/// contract as a vtable and is version-stamped in its own first slot for the
/// case a vtable cannot cover -- a document older than the reader.
/// 6: `ParamDesc::shownWhen` -- a control can say which other control decides
/// whether it is worth showing. A member in the middle of a struct the plugin
/// fills and the host reads, so every field after it moves: a bundle built
/// against 5 hands the host a `ParamDesc` whose hints, choices and defaults are
/// all at the wrong offsets. Forgetting to bump this is what took the render
/// host down in a restart loop rather than refusing one stale bundle, which is
/// the entire argument for the number existing.
/// 7: `ParamDesc::parent` and `ParamType::Group` -- a control can sit under a
/// heading instead of in a flat list. The member moves every field after it,
/// like 6 did; the enumerator does not, and is bundled here rather than
/// spending a number of its own.
/// 8: `Gpu::inferShaped` -- a network exported with dynamic dimensions can be
/// given a canvas. A new virtual on the host interface, same argument as 2.
/// 9: `ClipDesc::wantsPlanes` -- an input can ask for every plane of what
/// feeds it. A member of a struct the plugin fills, same argument as 6.
/// Still 9 with `aofx/Transform.h` added: inline functions only, nothing
/// crosses the boundary, so a bundle built without the header is a bundle
/// built against the same interface.
/// 10: `Gpu::read`, a buffer back to the CPU -- for the small answers a model
/// leaves in one (a pose, a count), never a picture. Every plugin rebuilt.
/// 11: `RecorderDesc::depth` and `::pixelAspect`, and `RenderRequest::
/// pixelAspect` beside the rate. Members appended to two structs the plugin
/// fills and the host reads -- the same argument as 6, and the reason a Write
/// of ours could not yet say what the built-in one always could: half against
/// float, and the aspect that goes in the header.
/// 12: `ParamDesc::shownAlso` -- a second condition on a row, both of which
/// must hold. A member in the middle of a struct the plugin fills, so every
/// field after it moves: the same argument as 6, which is the member it sits
/// next to.
/// 13: `ParamRole::ItemCount` and `::ItemIndex` -- an effect can say that N
/// slots are a list, and get one instead of two spin boxes. Enumerators, which
/// move no member; bundled with a number of their own anyway because the host
/// now behaves differently for a bundle that uses them, and "same interface,
/// different behaviour" is exactly what the number is for.
/// 17: `ParamDesc::startsDelivery` -- a button can say it means "run this node
/// now" rather than "set a flag for later". A member in the middle of a struct
/// the plugin fills, so every field after it moves: the same argument as 6.
/// Without it a delivery node's button did nothing visible, because the work
/// it arms happens in a delivery the operator had to know to go and start.
/// 14: `RenderRequest::analysing` and the range it is walking. Members
/// appended to a struct the plugin fills and the host reads -- the same
/// argument as 6 -- and the reason an effect with state can exist at all: the
/// ordinary render path prefetches and drops frames, so this is where the host
/// promises a range in order, once each.
/// 15: `ClipDesc::hostWired` -- an input the host fills by itself, which is
/// therefore not a port. The 3D renderer's four texture registers are the
/// case: the engine walks the scene, renders each piece of geometry's picture
/// and binds it, and nobody wires one by hand. Drawn as ports they left the
/// Scene with nowhere to go.
/// 16: `EffectDesc::offline` -- an effect whose work happens only in a
/// delivery. A member appended to a struct the plugin fills and the host
/// reads, and a host that now treats such a node as a delivery target and
/// waits on the job it reports; a plugin built against 15 is read as
/// `offline = false`, which is what it was.
/// 18: `ParamDesc::stampsFrameInto` -- a button can name the Integer
/// parameter the host writes the current frame into when it is pressed: a
/// tracker's "Start again" on frame 20 starts from frame 20. Appended to the
/// struct, so a plugin built against 17 reads as empty.
/// 19: `Effect::regionOfDefinition(const RegionQuery&)` -- the region
/// question carries a way to ask the host how big a clip is, so a source
/// can answer with its picture's own rectangle instead of the project's.
/// A 1300-square PNG declared 1920 by 1080 for a year, and every Crop,
/// Transform and gizmo above it was placed against a box that was not
/// there. A new virtual appended to the class, defaulting to the old
/// question; a plugin built against 18 is asked the old question. And
/// `InputPlane::rod`, the whole picture an input buffer is a piece of,
/// appended to the struct: a Transform pivoting on "the middle of the
/// picture" pivoted on the middle of whatever piece it had asked for. And
/// `regionOfInterest(const RegionQuery&, const Rect&)`, the region of
/// interest with the render's scale in it, for an effect whose knobs are in
/// canonical pixels and whose rectangles are not.
/// 20: sound. `aofx/Audio.h`; `InputPlane::audio`, `RenderRequest::audio`
/// with the project's `audioFormat` and `audioFrames`, `ClipInfo::hasAudio`
/// and `RecorderDesc::audioCodec` appended to structs the plugin fills and
/// the host reads (the argument of 6); `EffectDesc::audio` and `::audioOnly`
/// appended likewise; `Gpu::record` grows a fourth argument and
/// `Gpu::decodeAudio` is a new virtual (the argument of 2). Every plugin
/// rebuilt, and a bundle built against 19 refused rather than handed a
/// request whose fields it would read at the wrong offsets.
/// 21: identity in a box. `aofx::kAttachedBoxStride` goes from six to seven
/// and `meta.z` of a box buffer stops being the constant 1 and starts being
/// the track number -- McByte follows a player through a match and the number
/// it gives him had nowhere to travel. Not a vtable and not a struct layout:
/// an agreement about the contents of an array, which is exactly what 5 was
/// bumped for. A bundle built against 20 attaches rows of six that the host
/// reads as rows of seven, and every box after the first is the previous
/// one's numbers shifted along.
/// 22: `RenderRequest::bufferFrames`, the machine's latency budget -- the
/// depth of the live jitter buffer -- so a node that needs to look ahead
/// before it answers spends the number this system already states instead of
/// inventing a second one. A struct layout change, so every bundle is
/// rebuilt: one built against 21 would read every field after it from the
/// wrong offset.
inline constexpr int kAbiVersion = 22;

/// What this translation unit was compiled with.
///
/// Compiled into the plugin and into the host from the same header, so the two
/// strings are produced by the two compilers that actually built them. Comparing
/// them catches the case the version number cannot: same interface, different
/// toolchain, and a `std::string` that means something different on each side.
