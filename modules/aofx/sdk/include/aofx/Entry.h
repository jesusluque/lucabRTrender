// The four symbols a bundle exports, and the macro that writes them.
//
// VISIBILITY IS LOAD-BEARING
//
// This project builds with hidden visibility, which is right for every library
// in it and fatal for a plugin: these are the only symbols a host looks for.
// Hidden, the bundle loads, `dlsym` returns null, and the effect is simply
// absent from the menu with nothing said anywhere -- which has already happened
// once here, to the OpenFX blur.
//
// So the macro marks them visible itself rather than trusting a build to have
// undone the default. A plugin's CMake should undo it as well, and the two
// together are cheaper than the afternoon spent finding out why an effect that
// clearly exists is not in the list.
