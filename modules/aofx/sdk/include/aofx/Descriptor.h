// Plain data, filled in once. The host turns it into the same description it
// builds for an OpenFX plugin, so the properties panel, the node menu, the port
// labels, the MCP server and the command line all work on an AOFX effect
// without knowing there is a second kind of plugin. That translation is the
// only place the two vocabularies meet, and it is the host's job.
